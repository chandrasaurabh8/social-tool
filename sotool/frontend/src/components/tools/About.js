        <p>
          This is created on 2020 during lockdown out of boredom and for pure
          learning purpose.... You can't be funny for funny's sake. You try to
          get as outrageous situation as you can but it always has to be
          believable and based in real character motivations and what people
          would really do. - Hank Azaria.... If you have a secret, people will
          sit a little bit closer. - Rob Corddry.... People don't want to listen
          to a celebrity tweeting about their charities and shows. That's why
          comedy writers do well - we put out little funny ideas. - Mindy
          Kaling.... I cannot sing, dance or act what else would I be but a talk
          show host. - David Letterman....
